# pygame-context-menu
Adds a class to provide right-click "Context Menus" to pygame. This is the menu which appears when you right-click on the desktop or a file or folder in Windows. It gives you added functionality by offering you actions you can take with the clicked item. Most programs like to stuff their commands in this menu, and pygame didn't provide one.
